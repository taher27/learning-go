================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Nil Pointer Dereference
Issue: The code does not check if 'cur' is nil before dereferencing it which might cause a panic at runtime.
Solution: Add a nil check before dereferencing 'cur'.

Vulnerability: Infinite Loop
Issue: If the linked list is not properly formed and the 'next' of a node points to a previous node in the list, this could result in an infinite loop.
Solution: Ensure that the linked list is properly formed and consider using a set to track visited nodes.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing DisplayReverse function with an empty LinkedList

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the DisplayReverse function when the LinkedList is empty. The function should not throw any error or panic and should simply return without doing anything.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of LinkedList with no nodes.
  Act: Invoke the DisplayReverse function on the empty LinkedList.
  Assert: Since the function doesn't return anything, there's no direct output to assert. However, we should assert that the function does not cause a panic.

Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the behavior of the function when dealing with an empty list. It's important to test this scenario as it represents the edge case when the LinkedList is empty.

Scenario 2: Testing DisplayReverse function with a LinkedList containing one node

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the DisplayReverse function when the LinkedList contains only one node. The function should not throw any error or panic and should simply print the value of the node.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of LinkedList with one node.
  Act: Invoke the DisplayReverse function on the LinkedList.
  Assert: Capture the output of the function and assert that it matches the expected output.

Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the behavior of the function when dealing with a list containing a single node. It's important to test this scenario as it represents the edge case when the LinkedList only contains one node.

Scenario 3: Testing DisplayReverse function with a LinkedList containing multiple nodes

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the DisplayReverse function when the LinkedList contains multiple nodes. The function should print the values of the nodes in reverse order.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of LinkedList with multiple nodes.
  Act: Invoke the DisplayReverse function on the LinkedList.
  Assert: Capture the output of the function and assert that it matches the expected output.

Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the behavior of the function when dealing with a list containing multiple nodes. It's important to test this scenario as it represents the normal operation of the function.

Scenario 4: Testing DisplayReverse function with a LinkedList containing nodes with duplicate values

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the DisplayReverse function when the LinkedList contains nodes with duplicate values. The function should print the values of the nodes in reverse order, including the duplicate values.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of LinkedList with nodes having duplicate values.
  Act: Invoke the DisplayReverse function on the LinkedList.
  Assert: Capture the output of the function and assert that it matches the expected output.

Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the behavior of the function when dealing with a list containing nodes with duplicate values. It's important to test this scenario as it represents a common scenario in real-world applications.
