================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: N/A
Issue: The code does not have any apparent security vulnerabilities. However, it does lack error handling and data validation.
Solution: Introduce error handling and data validation mechanisms to ensure the LinkedList is not null before counting its nodes.

Vulnerability: N/A
Issue: The code is not using any imported packages, which is not necessarily an issue, but it could mean that it's not taking advantage of Go's standard library or other useful third-party libraries.
Solution: Consider using Go's standard library or other well-tested third-party libraries to improve the robustness and security of your code.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing Count() on an Empty LinkedList

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Count() function when called on an empty LinkedList. It should return 0 as there are no nodes in the LinkedList.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of LinkedList with no nodes.
  Act: Call the Count() function on the LinkedList instance.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the expected outcome which is 0.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the logic that an empty LinkedList should have a count of 0. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves correctly for edge cases and doesn't cause any unexpected behavior or errors.

Scenario 2: Testing Count() on a LinkedList with Single Node

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Count() function when called on a LinkedList with a single node. It should return 1 as there is only one node in the LinkedList.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of LinkedList with one node.
  Act: Call the Count() function on the LinkedList instance.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the expected outcome which is 1.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the logic that a LinkedList with a single node should have a count of 1. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves correctly for edge cases and doesn't cause any unexpected behavior or errors.

Scenario 3: Testing Count() on a LinkedList with Multiple Nodes

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Count() function when called on a LinkedList with multiple nodes. It should return the number of nodes in the LinkedList.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of LinkedList with multiple nodes.
  Act: Call the Count() function on the LinkedList instance.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the expected outcome which is the number of nodes in the LinkedList.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the logic that a LinkedList with multiple nodes should return the number of nodes as count. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves correctly in normal operation and returns the correct count.

Scenario 4: Testing Count() after Adding or Removing Nodes

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Count() function when nodes are added or removed from the LinkedList. The Count() function should always return the correct number of nodes in the LinkedList.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of LinkedList with multiple nodes, add or remove nodes.
  Act: Call the Count() function on the LinkedList instance.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual result matches the expected outcome which is the updated number of nodes in the LinkedList.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the logic that the Count() function should always return the correct number of nodes even after adding or removing nodes. This test is important to ensure that the function behaves correctly after changes are made to the LinkedList.
